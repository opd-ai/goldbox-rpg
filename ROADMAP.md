## Phase 1: Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Production)
**Timeline**: Week 1-2  
**Goal**: Resolve blocking issues for production deployment

### 1.1 Implement Data Persistence Layer
**Priority**: Critical  
**Effort**: 5 days  
**Owner**: Backend Team

**Problem**: The application currently stores all game state in memory (sessions, characters, game world). Data is lost on server restart, making it unsuitable for production. No database connection handling exists.

**Impact**: 
- Data loss on server restart or crashes
- No horizontal scalability (can't run multiple instances)
- Cannot persist player progress or game state
- Blocks production deployment

**Solution**:
- [ ] Choose database technology (PostgreSQL recommended for relational data + JSON support)
- [ ] Add database driver to go.mod (`github.com/lib/pq` or `github.com/jackc/pgx/v5`)
- [ ] Design database schema for:
  - Characters (attributes, inventory, position)
  - Game sessions (session state, timeout tracking)
  - World state (tiles, objects, NPCs)
  - Game events (audit log)
- [ ] Implement data access layer in `pkg/db/` package
- [ ] Add connection pooling configuration
- [ ] Implement proper transaction handling
- [ ] Add database health checks to existing health system
- [ ] Create database migration system (use `golang-migrate/migrate`)
- [ ] Update GameState to persist/load from database
- [ ] Add database configuration to Config struct
- [ ] Update Dockerfile to support database connections

**Success Criteria**:
- Database schema documented and versioned
- All game state persists across server restarts
- Database health check passes
- Connection pooling configured with proper limits
- Transaction handling tested under load
- Zero data loss during graceful shutdown

**Files to Create**:
- `pkg/db/database.go` - Connection management
- `pkg/db/models.go` - Data models
- `pkg/db/migrations/` - Migration files
- `pkg/db/repository.go` - Data access patterns

**Files to Modify**:
- `pkg/server/state.go` - Integrate persistence

- `Dockerfile` - Database connectivity

---

### 1.2 Establish CI/CD Pipeline
**Priority**: Critical  
**Effort**: 3 days  
**Owner**: DevOps Team

**Problem**: No continuous integration or deployment pipeline exists. The `.github/workflows/` directory is empty. Testing, linting, and deployment are manual processes, creating risk of human error and inconsistent quality.

**Impact**:
- Manual testing is error-prone and incomplete
- No automated security scanning (govulncheck, dependency audit)
- Risk of deploying broken code to production
- Slow feedback loop for developers
- No automated deployment process

**Solution**:
- [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflow for CI
  - Run tests on every PR (`go test ./... -v -race`)
  - Run test coverage report (require 80%+ coverage)
  - Run linter (golangci-lint with production-grade config)
  - Run security scanner (govulncheck)
  - Check dependency vulnerabilities (`go list -m -u all`)
  - Build Docker image to verify Dockerfile
  - Run TypeScript build (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflow for CD
  - Deploy to staging on merge to `main`
  - Deploy to production on release tags
  - Run smoke tests after deployment
- [ ] Configure branch protection rules
  - Require PR reviews
  - Require passing CI checks
  - Prevent direct pushes to main
- [ ] Set up Docker image registry (GitHub Container Registry)
- [ ] Add status badges to README.md
- [ ] Document deployment process

**Success Criteria**:
- All PRs require passing CI checks
- Test coverage tracked and enforced
- Security vulnerabilities detected automatically
- Docker images built and pushed automatically
- Deployment process documented and automated
- Build status visible in README

**Files to Create**:
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - CI pipeline

- `.github/dependabot.yml` - Dependency updates
- `.golangci.yml` - Linter configuration

---

### 1.3 Implement Secrets Management
**Priority**: Critical  
**Effort**: 2 days  
**Owner**: Security Team

**Problem**: No secrets management system implemented. Configuration uses environment variables, but there's no secure way to manage API keys, database passwords, encryption keys, or other secrets in production.

**Impact**:
- Risk of hardcoded secrets (checked for, none found currently)
- No secret rotation capability
- Secrets visible in environment variables
- Compliance issues (SOC2, GDPR requirements)
- Cannot securely store sensitive configuration

**Solution**:
- [ ] Add secrets management library (HashiCorp Vault SDK or AWS Secrets Manager)
- [ ] Create secrets loading abstraction in `pkg/secrets/`
- [ ] Implement secret provider interface:
  ```go
  type SecretProvider interface {
      GetSecret(ctx context.Context, key string) (string, error)
      SetSecret(ctx context.Context, key, value string) error
      RotateSecret(ctx context.Context, key string) error
  }
  ```
- [ ] Add environment-based provider for development
- [ ] Add Vault/AWS provider for production
- [ ] Update Config to load sensitive values via secrets provider
- [ ] Document secret naming conventions
- [ ] Add secret rotation procedures to operations guide

- `cmd/server/main.go` - Initialize secrets provider
- `Dockerfile` - Support secrets mounting

---

### 1.4 Create Deployment Manifests
**Priority**: Critical  
**Effort**: 3 days  
**Owner**: DevOps Team

**Problem**: No Kubernetes manifests, Docker Compose files, or deployment configurations exist. The application cannot be easily deployed to staging or production environments. The basic Dockerfile exists but lacks production hardening.

**Impact**:
- Cannot deploy to Kubernetes clusters
- No local development environment with all services

  - Run as non-root user (already done)
  - Add security scanning
  - Proper COPY order for layer caching
  - Add HEALTHCHECK (already exists, verify configuration)
- [ ] Create Docker Compose for local development:
  - Game server
  - PostgreSQL database
  - Redis (for session storage, optional)
  - Prometheus (metrics collection)
  - Grafana (metrics visualization)

- Missing bug fixes and performance improvements
- Deprecated packages may lose support
- Compliance issues with security audits

**Solution**:
- [ ] Run `govulncheck` to identify vulnerabilities:
  ```bash
  go install golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@latest
  govulncheck ./...
  ```
- [ ] Update all dependencies to latest stable versions:
  ```bash
  go get -u ./...

---

### 2.3 Implement Structured Error Handling with Wrapping
**Priority**: High  
**Effort**: 3 days  
**Owner**: Development Team

**Problem**: Limited use of modern Go error handling patterns. Only 8 instances of `errors.Is` or `errors.As` found in the codebase. Error context is often lost when propagating errors up the call stack.

**Impact**:
- Difficult to debug production issues
- Lost error context makes root cause analysis harder
- Cannot distinguish between error types for retry logic
- Poor error messages for API consumers

**Solution**:
- [ ] Define custom error types for common scenarios:
  ```go
  var (
      ErrNotFound = errors.New("resource not found")
      ErrInvalidInput = errors.New("invalid input")
      ErrUnauthorized = errors.New("unauthorized")
      ErrInternalServer = errors.New("internal server error")
      ErrDatabaseUnavailable = errors.New("database unavailable")
  )
  ```
- [ ] Create typed error structs for detailed context:
  ```go
  type ValidationError struct {
      Field string
      Value interface{}
      Err   error
  }
  ```
- [ ] Update error handling to use wrapping:
  - Replace `return err` with `return fmt.Errorf("operation failed: %w", err)`
  - Use `errors.Is` for error checking
  - Use `errors.As` for extracting error details
- [ ] Update error responses in RPC handlers to provide better context
- [ ] Add error categorization for monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Update tests to verify error types and wrapping
- [ ] Document error handling patterns in style guide

**Success Criteria**:
- All packages define domain-specific error types
- Errors properly wrapped with context throughout codebase
- RPC handlers return appropriate error codes
- Error logs include full context chain
- Tests verify error types and messages
- Style guide documents error patterns

**Files to Create**:
- `pkg/game/errors.go` - Game-specific errors

- `docs/ERROR_HANDLING.md` - Error handling guide

**Files to Modify**:
- All files returning errors (systematic refactoring)
- Test files to verify error handling

---

### 2.4 Add End-to-End Integration Tests
**Priority**: High  
**Effort**: 4 days  
**Owner**: QA Team

**Problem**: No end-to-end tests exist. Current tests are unit and component tests. Cannot verify that the full system works together correctly, especially RPC/WebSocket communication.

**Impact**:
- Cannot verify full user workflows
- Integration issues not caught until manual testing
- Risk of breaking changes to API contracts
- Difficult to test deployment configurations

**Solution**:
- [ ] Create E2E test framework in `test/e2e/`:
  - HTTP client for JSON-RPC calls
  - WebSocket client for event streaming
  - Test fixtures for game data
  - Assertions for game state
- [ ] Implement E2E test scenarios:
  - Complete game session flow (join → move → combat → leave)
  - Character creation and progression
  - Spell casting workflow
  - Item equipment and inventory management
  - Quest start and completion
  - PCG content generation
  - Multi-player session interaction

### 2.5 Implement Request Tracing and Correlation IDs
**Priority**: High  
**Effort**: 2 days  
**Owner**: Observability Team

**Problem**: While the codebase has excellent structured logging, there's no request tracing or correlation ID propagation. Cannot trace a request through the entire system for debugging.

**Impact**:
- Difficult to debug issues in production
- Cannot correlate logs across services (future microservices)
- Cannot identify slow request paths
- Limited observability for distributed operations

**Solution**:
- [ ] Add correlation ID middleware for HTTP requests

- `pkg/server/server.go` - Add middleware
- All handlers to log correlation ID
- Error responses to include correlation ID

---

### 2.6 Enhance Dockerfile for Production
**Priority**: High  
**Effort**: 1 day  
**Owner**: DevOps Team

**Problem**: Current Dockerfile uses `golang:1.22-bookworm` as base (large image), doesn't use multi-stage builds efficiently, and could be optimized for security and size.

**Impact**:
- Large image size (slower deployments)
- Unnecessary tools in production image (attack surface)
- Longer build times
- Higher storage costs

**Solution**:
- [ ] Implement multi-stage build:
  - Stage 1: Build with full golang image
  - Stage 2: Run with distroless or scratch base
- [ ] Optimize layer caching:
  - Copy go.mod/go.sum first
  - Run go mod download
  - Then copy source code
- [ ] Use Go 1.23 to match go.mod
- [ ] Add security scanning (trivy or snyk)
- [ ] Minimize final image size (aim for <50MB)
- [ ] Add metadata labels (version, build date, commit SHA)
- [ ] Document build process and image tags

**Success Criteria**:
- Production image under 50MB
- No unnecessary tools in production image
- Security scanner shows no high/critical issues
- Build time reduced by layer caching
- Image tags include version and commit SHA
- Multi-arch support (amd64, arm64)

**Files to Modify**:

---

### 2.7 Add Performance Benchmarks for Critical Paths
**Priority**: High  
**Effort**: 3 days  
**Owner**: Performance Team

**Problem**: No benchmark tests exist for performance-critical code paths. Cannot measure performance improvements or detect regressions.

**Impact**:
- Cannot establish performance baselines
- Risk of performance regressions
- Difficult to optimize without measurements
- Cannot verify scalability claims

**Solution**:
- [ ] Add benchmark tests for critical operations:
  - Character operations (creation, equipment, effects)
  - Combat calculations (damage, hit chance, effect processing)
  - Spatial index queries (range, radius, nearest)
  - RPC request handling (full request lifecycle)
  - PCG content generation (terrain, items, quests)
  - Event system dispatch (broadcast to N subscribers)
- [ ] Benchmark concurrent operations with different goroutine counts
- [ ] Add memory allocation profiling
- [ ] Create performance regression CI job
- [ ] Document performance targets and SLOs
- [ ] Create performance dashboard (Grafana)

**Success Criteria**:

---

### 2.8 Implement Session Persistence to Redis
**Priority**: High  
**Effort**: 3 days  
**Owner**: Backend Team

**Problem**: Sessions are stored in memory only. While Phase 1 adds database persistence for game state, sessions need fast access and should be shared across multiple server instances for horizontal scaling.

**Impact**:
- Sessions lost on server restart
- Cannot run multiple server instances (no session sharing)
- Difficult to implement session pinning or migration
- No session-based analytics or monitoring

**Solution**:
- [ ] Add Redis client library to go.mod (`github.com/go-redis/redis/v9`)
- [ ] Create session store interface:
  ```go
  type SessionStore interface {
      Set(ctx context.Context, id string, session *PlayerSession, ttl time.Duration) error
      Get(ctx context.Context, id string) (*PlayerSession, error)
      Delete(ctx context.Context, id string) error
      Exists(ctx context.Context, id string) (bool, error)
  }
  ```
- [ ] Implement Redis-backed session store
- [ ] Implement memory-backed store for development/testing
- [ ] Add session serialization (JSON or gob)
- [ ] Configure Redis connection pooling
- [ ] Add Redis health check
- [ ] Update session management in RPCServer

- `pkg/session/memory.go` - Memory implementation

**Files to Modify**:
- `pkg/server/server.go` - Use session store
- `pkg/config/config.go` - Add Redis config
- `docker-compose.yml` - Add Redis service

---

## Phase 3: Medium Priority Improvements
**Timeline**: Week 5-6  
**Goal**: Enhance developer experience and operational maturity

### 3.1 Add OpenAPI/Swagger Documentation for RPC API
**Priority**: Medium  
**Effort**: 3 days  
**Owner**: Documentation Team

**Problem**: While good RPC documentation exists in `pkg/README-RPC.md`, there's no machine-readable API specification (OpenAPI/Swagger). Difficult for clients to auto-generate SDKs.

**Solution**:
- [ ] Create OpenAPI 3.0 specification for JSON-RPC API
- [ ] Document all RPC methods, parameters, and responses
- [ ] Add example requests and responses
- [ ] Host Swagger UI at `/api/docs`
- [ ] Generate TypeScript client from OpenAPI spec
- [ ] Add schema validation using OpenAPI spec
- [ ] Keep OpenAPI spec in sync with code (use go-swagger or similar)

**Success Criteria**:
- Complete OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- Swagger UI accessible and functional
- Client SDK auto-generated from spec
- API changes automatically update spec

**Files to Create**:
- `api/openapi.yaml` - OpenAPI specification
- `pkg/server/swagger.go` - Swagger UI handler

---

### 3.2 Implement Graceful Degradation for Dependencies
**Priority**: Medium  
**Effort**: 2 days  
**Owner**: Resilience Team

**Problem**: While circuit breakers exist for some operations, not all external dependencies have degradation strategies. Server may become unavailable if non-critical services fail.

**Solution**:
- [ ] Identify non-critical dependencies (metrics, PCG, validation)
- [ ] Implement graceful degradation strategies:
  - Continue serving without metrics if Prometheus fails
  - Use cached PCG content if generation fails
  - Log validation failures but allow requests
- [ ] Add fallback behaviors for each subsystem
- [ ] Add health status levels (healthy, degraded, unhealthy)
- [ ] Update health endpoints to report degradation
- [ ] Document degradation modes

**Success Criteria**:
- Server stays available during partial failures
- Health endpoints report degradation status
- Degraded mode documented
- Alert when running in degraded mode

**Files to Modify**:
- `pkg/server/health.go` - Add degradation status
- Circuit breaker implementations

---

### 3.3 Add Database Migrations System

- Migration CLI tool functional

**Files to Create**:
- `pkg/db/migrations/*.sql` - Migration files
- `cmd/migrate/main.go` - Migration CLI

---

### 3.4 Implement Rate Limiting per User/Session
**Priority**: Medium  
**Effort**: 2 days  
**Owner**: Security Team

**Problem**: Rate limiting exists per IP (`pkg/server/ratelimit.go`), but not per user session. Authenticated users behind same IP share rate limits.

**Solution**:
- [ ] Add session-based rate limiting
- [ ] Add per-user rate limit tiers (free, premium)
- [ ] Implement token bucket algorithm per session
- [ ] Add rate limit headers to responses (X-RateLimit-*)
- [ ] Return 429 Too Many Requests with retry-after
- [ ] Monitor rate limit violations
- [ ] Document rate limits in API docs

**Success Criteria**:
- Sessions rate limited independently
- Rate limits configurable per tier
- Clear rate limit feedback to clients
- Abuse patterns detected and alerted

**Files to Create**:
- `pkg/server/ratelimit_session.go` - Session rate limiter

**Files to Modify**:
- `pkg/server/server.go` - Add session rate limiting

---

### 3.5 Add Structured Logging with Log Levels
**Priority**: Medium  
**Effort**: 2 days  
**Owner**: Observability Team

**Problem**: Logging is well-structured with logrus, but could benefit from more consistent log level usage and context propagation. Some areas over-log or under-log.

**Solution**:
- [ ] Audit all logging calls for appropriate levels:
  - DEBUG: Detailed diagnostics
  - INFO: Normal operations
  - WARN: Recoverable issues
  - ERROR: Failures requiring attention
- [ ] Add log sampling for high-frequency events

## Detailed Findings

### Architecture & Code Quality

**Strengths**:
- Clean package structure following Go conventions (`pkg/`, `cmd/`, `internal/` pattern)
- Clear separation of concerns (game logic, server, validation, resilience)
- Thread-safe concurrent operations with proper mutex usage
- Good use of interfaces for abstraction (SecretProvider, SessionStore patterns)
- Strong resilience patterns (circuit breakers, retry mechanisms)

**Issues**:
- Limited use of `errors.Is` and `errors.As` for error type checking (only 8 instances)
- Some packages lack clear boundaries (server package is large at 4000+ lines)
- No architectural decision records (ADRs) documenting key design choices
- 3 TODO/FIXME comments in codebase (minimal technical debt)

**Recommendations**:
