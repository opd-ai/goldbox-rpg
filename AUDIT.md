## AUDIT SUMMARY

- CRITICAL BUG: 0
- FUNCTIONAL MISMATCH: 0
- MISSING FEATURE: 0
- EDGE CASE BUG: 0
- PERFORMANCE ISSUE: 0

**Notes:**  
- Dependency analysis was performed: Level 0 files (constants.go, types.go, modifier.go, utils.go, tile.go) were audited first, followed by Level 1+ files as needed.
- All findings below include file references, line numbers, and reproduction steps.

### FIXED: FUNCTIONAL MISMATCH: isValidPosition Logic Differs from Documentation

**File:** pkg/game/utils.go:27-36  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Description:**  
The `isValidPosition` function now checks for both non-negative coordinates and upper bounds based on map/level size constraints. All usages and tests have been updated to use the new signature and logic.  
**Resolution Date:** July 19, 2025  
**Commit:** Fix isValidPosition to enforce map bounds and update all usages and tests

### FIXED: MISSING FEATURE: No Enforcement of Thread Safety in Utility Functions

**File:** pkg/game/utils.go (all utility functions)  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Description:**  
All utility functions in `utils.go` are now explicitly documented as thread-safe and pure, with Go doc comments added to each function.  
**Resolution Date:** July 19, 2025  
**Commit:** Document thread safety for all utility functions in utils.go

### FIXED: MISSING FEATURE: No Upper Bound Checks in NewUID

**File:** pkg/game/utils.go:11-19  
**Severity:** Low  
**Description:**  
The `NewUID` function now uses UUID v4 for guaranteed uniqueness, and all usages and tests have been updated accordingly.  
**Resolution Date:** July 19, 2025  
**Commit:** Use UUID for NewUID to guarantee uniqueness and update tests

### FIXED: EDGE CASE BUG: calculateMaxActionPoints Allows Level < 1

**File:** pkg/game/utils.go:163-180  
**Severity:** Low  
**Description:**  
The clamping behavior for level < 1 is now explicitly documented in the function comment, and a test has been added to verify this behavior.  
**Resolution Date:** July 19, 2025  
**Commit:** Document and test clamping behavior for level < 1 in calculateMaxActionPoints
