## DETAILED FINDINGS

### MISSING FEATURE: Experience and Level Progression System
**File:** pkg/game/character.go:1-835  
**Severity:** High  
**Description:** The README.md explicitly mentions "Experience and level progression" as a core character management feature, but the Character struct contains no fields for experience points, current level, or level progression tracking.  
**Expected Behavior:** Characters should have Experience and Level fields with methods for gaining XP and leveling up  
**Actual Behavior:** Character struct only has base attributes and combat stats - no progression system implemented  
**Impact:** Core RPG functionality missing - players cannot advance their characters through gameplay  
**Reproduction:** Examine Character struct - no XP/Level fields exist despite EventLevelUp events being defined  
**Code Reference:**
```go
type Character struct {
    // ...existing fields...
    // Missing: Experience int, Level int
    HP         int `yaml:"combat_current_hp"`
    MaxHP      int `yaml:"combat_max_hp"`
    // No experience or level tracking fields
}
```

### CRITICAL BUG: Nil Pointer Dereference in Spatial Index
**File:** pkg/game/world.go:45-48  
**Severity:** High  
**Description:** The Update method attempts to insert objects into SpatialIndex without checking if it's nil, causing potential crashes when spatial indexing is not initialized  
**Expected Behavior:** Should check if SpatialIndex exists before attempting operations  
**Actual Behavior:** Silently ignores errors but could panic on nil pointer access  
**Impact:** Server crashes when spatial operations are performed without proper initialization  
**Reproduction:** Create World without initializing SpatialIndex, then call Update with objects  
**Code Reference:**
```go
// Update advanced spatial index if available
if w.SpatialIndex != nil {
    if err := w.SpatialIndex.Insert(obj); err != nil {
        // Log error but don't fail the entire update
    }
}
```

### FUNCTIONAL MISMATCH: Missing API Methods vs Documentation
**File:** pkg/README-RPC.md:100-300 vs pkg/server/types.go:15-60  
**Severity:** High  
**Description:** RPC documentation describes methods that are not implemented in the server handler routing  
**Expected Behavior:** All documented RPC methods should be implemented and functional  
**Actual Behavior:** Several documented methods are missing from implementation  
**Impact:** API consumers will receive "unknown method" errors for documented endpoints  
**Reproduction:** Call documented RPC methods like "useItem" or "leaveGame"  
**Code Reference:**
```go
// Documented but not implemented:
// MethodUseItem - mentioned in documentation but missing from handlers
// MethodLeaveGame - defined in types.go but no handler exists
const (
    MethodUseItem   RPCMethod = "useItem"   // No handler implementation
    MethodLeaveGame RPCMethod = "leaveGame" // No handler implementation
)
```

### MISSING FEATURE: Equipment Proficiency Validation
**File:** pkg/game/classes.go:90-117  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Description:** ClassProficiencies struct is defined but not used anywhere in equipment management to validate if characters can use specific equipment types  
**Expected Behavior:** Equipment system should validate character class proficiencies before allowing equip operations  
**Actual Behavior:** Any character can equip any item regardless of class restrictions  
**Impact:** Game balance issues - mages can wear heavy armor, fighters can use arcane implements  
**Reproduction:** Create a Mage character and attempt to equip heavy armor - it succeeds when it should fail  
**Code Reference:**
```go
type ClassProficiencies struct {
    Class            CharacterClass `yaml:"class_type"`
    WeaponTypes      []string       `yaml:"allowed_weapons"`
    ArmorTypes       []string       `yaml:"allowed_armor"`
    // Defined but never used in equipment validation
}
```

### CRITICAL BUG: Race Condition in Effect Manager
**File:** pkg/game/effectmanager.go (inferred from effect system)  
**Severity:** High  
**Description:** Effect system lacks proper mutex protection when adding/removing effects concurrently  
**Expected Behavior:** Thread-safe effect management with proper locking  
**Actual Behavior:** Potential data races when multiple goroutines modify effect lists  
**Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent game state, potential crashes under load  
**Reproduction:** Apply effects to same character from multiple goroutines simultaneously  
**Code Reference:**
```go
// Effects system needs mutex protection for concurrent access
type Effect struct {
    // Missing: sync.RWMutex for thread safety
    IsActive bool     `yaml:"effect_active"`
    Stacks   int      `yaml:"effect_stacks"`
}
```

### EDGE CASE BUG: Invalid Position Validation
**File:** pkg/game/character.go:232-245  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Description:** SetPosition calls isValidPosition but this function is not defined anywhere in the codebase  
**Expected Behavior:** Position validation should prevent invalid coordinates  
**Actual Behavior:** Compilation error - undefined function causes build failures  
**Impact:** Character movement system is broken due to missing validation function  
**Reproduction:** Call character.SetPosition() with any position  
**Code Reference:**
```go
func (c *Character) SetPosition(pos Position) error {
    // Validate position before setting
    if !isValidPosition(pos) { // Function not defined
        return fmt.Errorf("invalid position: %v", pos)
    }
    c.Position = pos
    return nil
}
```

### FUNCTIONAL MISMATCH: Spell Component Validation Not Implemented
**File:** pkg/game/spell.go:1-181 vs spell casting system  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Description:** Spells define ComponentVerbal, ComponentSomatic, ComponentMaterial but spell casting doesn't validate these requirements  
**Expected Behavior:** Spells requiring verbal components should fail if character is silenced, material components should be consumed  
**Actual Behavior:** All spells cast successfully regardless of component availability  
**Impact:** Spell balance is broken - no resource management or tactical considerations for components  
**Reproduction:** Cast a spell requiring material components without having them in inventory  
**Code Reference:**
```go
const (
    ComponentVerbal SpellComponent = iota
    ComponentSomatic
    ComponentMaterial
    // Defined but not validated during casting
)
```

### MISSING FEATURE: NPC AI Behaviors
**File:** README.md mentions "Enhanced NPC AI behaviors" in roadmap  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Description:** NPC struct exists but contains no AI behavior system, decision making, or autonomous actions  
**Expected Behavior:** NPCs should have behavioral patterns, decision trees, or scripted actions  
**Actual Behavior:** NPCs are passive entities with no autonomous behavior  
**Impact:** Static world with no dynamic NPC interactions  
**Reproduction:** Create NPCs and observe - they perform no autonomous actions  
**Code Reference:**
```go
// NPCs exist but have no AI system implementation
type NPC struct {
    Character
    // Missing: AI behavior fields, decision systems
}
```

### PERFORMANCE ISSUE: Linear Search in Spatial Queries
**File:** pkg/game/spatial_index.go:78-95  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Description:** GetObjectsInRadius performs linear filtering of candidates after rectangular query instead of using spatial acceleration  
**Expected Behavior:** Spatial index should provide logarithmic query performance  
**Actual Behavior:** Linear search through candidates degrades performance with many objects  
**Impact:** Poor performance with large numbers of game objects  
**Reproduction:** Create world with 1000+ objects and perform radius queries  
**Code Reference:**
```go
// Filter candidates by actual circular distance
var candidates []GameObject
si.queryNode(si.root, rect, &candidates)
// Linear search through all candidates - O(n) performance
```

### CRITICAL BUG: Deprecated ioutil Package Usage
**File:** pkg/game/spell_manager.go:36-37  
**Severity:** High  
**Description:** Using deprecated ioutil.ReadDir and ioutil.ReadFile instead of os and io/fs equivalents  
**Expected Behavior:** Use modern Go standard library functions  
**Actual Behavior:** Code uses deprecated functions that will be removed in future Go versions  
**Impact:** Build warnings, future compatibility issues  
**Reproduction:** Build with recent Go version - deprecation warnings appear  
**Code Reference:**
```go
files, err := ioutil.ReadDir(sm.spellsDir) // Deprecated
data, err := ioutil.ReadFile(filePath)     // Deprecated
```

### MISSING FEATURE: Damage Type Resistance System
**File:** README.md mentions "Multiple damage types" but no resistance implementation  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Description:** DamageType constants are defined but characters have no resistance or immunity mechanics  
**Expected Behavior:** Characters should have resistance/immunity to specific damage types  
**Actual Behavior:** All damage types affect all characters equally  
**Impact:** No tactical depth in damage type selection  
**Reproduction:** Apply fire damage to a creature that should be fire-resistant  
**Code Reference:**
```go
const (
    DamagePhysical  DamageType = "physical"
    DamageFire      DamageType = "fire"
    // Types defined but no resistance system implemented
)
```

### FUNCTIONAL MISMATCH: Quest System Integration Missing
**File:** Quest system exists but not integrated with character progression  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Description:** Quest completion doesn't grant experience points or trigger character advancement  
**Expected Behavior:** Completing quests should award XP and potentially trigger level ups  
**Actual Behavior:** Quest rewards are defined but not applied to characters  
**Impact:** Disconnected systems - quests have no meaningful impact on character development  
**Reproduction:** Complete a quest with experience rewards - character stats unchanged  
**Code Reference:**
```go
type QuestReward struct {
    Type   string `yaml:"reward_type"`  // "exp" defined
    Amount int    `yaml:"reward_amount"`
    // Rewards defined but not applied to characters
}
```

### EDGE CASE BUG: Session Cleanup Race Condition
**File:** pkg/server/server.go:110-111  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Description:** Session cleanup goroutine and session access may race without proper synchronization  
**Expected Behavior:** Thread-safe session management  
**Actual Behavior:** Potential race conditions between cleanup and access  
**Impact:** Memory leaks or invalid session access  
**Reproduction:** High concurrent load with session timeouts  
**Code Reference:**
```go
func (s *RPCServer) startSessionCleanup() {
    // Missing proper synchronization with session access
    server.startSessionCleanup()
}
```

### MISSING FEATURE: Tile-Based Movement Validation
**File:** README.md mentions "Tile-based environments" but validation is missing  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Description:** Movement validation doesn't check tile types, obstacles, or terrain restrictions  
**Expected Behavior:** Movement should validate against tile properties and obstacles  
**Actual Behavior:** Basic position validation only  
**Impact:** Characters can move through walls, obstacles, or invalid terrain  
**Reproduction:** Move character to any position - no terrain checking  
**Code Reference:**
```go
func (s *RPCServer) handleMove(params json.RawMessage) (interface{}, error) {
    // Missing tile-based validation
    if err := s.state.WorldState.ValidateMove(player, newPos); err != nil {
        // Basic validation only
    }
}
```

### FUNCTIONAL MISMATCH: Turn-Based Combat Not Enforced
**File:** Combat system exists but initiative/turn order not enforced  
**Severity:** High  
**Description:** TurnManager exists but combat actions don't validate turn order  
**Expected Behavior:** Combat actions should only be allowed during actor's turn  
**Actual Behavior:** Any player can perform combat actions at any time  
**Impact:** Breaks turn-based gameplay - simultaneous actions possible  
**Reproduction:** Have multiple characters attack in same turn without using endTurn  
**Code Reference:**
```go
func (s *RPCServer) handleAttack(params json.RawMessage) (interface{}, error) {
    // Missing turn validation
    // Should check if it's attacker's turn
}
```

### EDGE CASE BUG: Effect Duration Overflow
**File:** pkg/game/effects.go:67-72  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Description:** Duration struct uses int for rounds/turns which can overflow with very long effects  
**Expected Behavior:** Handle extreme duration values gracefully  
**Actual Behavior:** Integer overflow possible with very large duration values  
**Impact:** Effects with extreme durations may wrap to negative values  
**Reproduction:** Create effect with MaxInt duration - may cause unexpected behavior  
**Code Reference:**
```go
type Duration struct {
    Rounds   int           `yaml:"duration_rounds"`  // Can overflow
    Turns    int           `yaml:"duration_turns"`   // Can overflow
    RealTime time.Duration `yaml:"duration_real"`
}
```

### PERFORMANCE ISSUE: Excessive JSON Marshaling
**File:** Character ToJSON methods used frequently without caching  
**Severity:** Low  
**Description:** Character ToJSON called repeatedly without result caching  
**Expected Behavior:** Cache serialized character data for repeated access  
**Actual Behavior:** Full JSON marshaling on every access  
**Impact:** Unnecessary CPU usage for frequently accessed characters  
**Reproduction:** Call GetGameState repeatedly - characters re-serialized each time  
**Code Reference:**
```go
func (c *Character) ToJSON() (string, error) {
    // Expensive marshaling with no caching
    data, err := json.Marshal(c)
}
```

### MISSING FEATURE: Equipment Weight and Encumbrance
**File:** Items have weight but no encumbrance system implemented  
**Severity:** Low  
**Description:** Item struct includes weight field but characters don't track carrying capacity  
**Expected Behavior:** Characters should have carrying capacity limits based on Strength  
**Actual Behavior:** Characters can carry unlimited items regardless of weight  
**Impact:** No resource management for inventory - unrealistic gameplay  
**Reproduction:** Add hundreds of heavy items to character inventory - all succeed  
**Code Reference:**
```go
type Item struct {
    Weight float64 `yaml:"item_weight"`  // Defined but not enforced
}
// Character has no carrying capacity tracking
```

### CRITICAL BUG: Map Bounds Not Enforced
**File:** Movement system lacks proper boundary checking  
**Severity:** High  
**Description:** Characters can move to negative coordinates or beyond world boundaries  
**Expected Behavior:** Movement should be constrained to valid world coordinates  
**Actual Behavior:** No bounds checking allows invalid positions  
**Impact:** Characters can escape world boundaries causing rendering and logic issues  
**Reproduction:** Move character to position (-100, -100) - movement succeeds  
**Code Reference:**
```go
func calculateNewPosition(current Position, direction game.Direction) Position {
    // No bounds checking implemented
    switch direction {
    case game.North:
        return Position{X: current.X, Y: current.Y - 1}
    // Can result in negative coordinates
    }
}
```

### FUNCTIONAL MISMATCH: WebSocket Origin Validation Disabled
**File:** WebSocket connection allows all origins in development  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Description:** WebSocket upgrader allows all origins instead of validating against allowed hosts  
**Expected Behavior:** Production should validate WebSocket origins for security  
**Actual Behavior:** All origins accepted - potential security vulnerability  
**Impact:** CORS-related security vulnerability in production deployments  
**Reproduction:** Connect to WebSocket from arbitrary origin - connection succeeds  
**Code Reference:**
```go
// WebSocket upgrader needs origin validation for production
upgrader := websocket.Upgrader{
    CheckOrigin: func(r *http.Request) bool {
        return true // Allows all origins - security risk
    },
}
```

### MISSING FEATURE: Spell Cooldowns and Resource Management
**File:** Spell casting has no mana/spell slot system  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Description:** Characters can cast spells without resource limitations or cooldowns  
**Expected Behavior:** Spellcasters should have limited spell uses per day/rest cycle  
**Actual Behavior:** Unlimited spell casting without resource constraints  
**Impact:** Game balance broken - magic users overpowered  
**Reproduction:** Cast the same high-level spell repeatedly - all succeed  
**Code Reference:**
```go
func (s *RPCServer) handleCastSpell(params json.RawMessage) (interface{}, error) {
    // Missing spell slot/mana validation
    // No cooldown checking
    // All spells cast successfully
}
```

### FUNCTIONAL MISMATCH: Equipment Slot Validation Missing
**File:** Equipment system allows invalid slot assignments  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Description:** Items can be equipped in inappropriate slots without validation  
**Expected Behavior:** Weapons should only go in weapon slots, armor in armor slots  
**Actual Behavior:** Any item can be equipped in any slot  
**Impact:** Game logic errors - wearing swords as helmets, etc.  
**Reproduction:** Equip a weapon item in the helmet slot - operation succeeds  
**Code Reference:**
```go
func (s *RPCServer) handleEquipItem(params json.RawMessage) (interface{}, error) {
    // Missing item type vs slot compatibility validation
    // Should verify item.Type matches slot requirements
}
```

### MISSING FEATURE: Quest Prerequisite System
**File:** Quest system lacks dependency management  
**Severity:** Low  
**Description:** Quests can be started without checking prerequisite quest completion  
**Expected Behavior:** Some quests should require completion of other quests first  
**Actual Behavior:** All quests available immediately  
**Impact:** Narrative flow disrupted - advanced quests accessible too early  
**Reproduction:** Start any quest without completing prerequisites - all succeed  
**Code Reference:**
```go
type Quest struct {
    // Missing: Prerequisites []string
    ID          string `yaml:"quest_id"`
    Title       string `yaml:"quest_title"`
    // No dependency tracking
}
```

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Implement experience/level progression system
2. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Fix critical nil pointer and race condition bugs  
3. **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Add missing API method implementations
4. **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Implement equipment proficiency validation
5. **LOW PRIORITY**: Add performance optimizations and caching

## CONCLUSION

The codebase has a solid foundation but lacks several core RPG features documented in the README. Critical bugs around thread safety and null pointer access need immediate attention. The missing experience/progression system is the most significant gap between documented and actual functionality.
