# Implementation Summary: Quest Objectives System

## Component Implemented
- **File**: `pkg/pcg/quests/objectives.go`
- **Test File**: `pkg/pcg/quests/objectives_test.go`
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

## Overview
Implemented the missing quest objectives generator component from the PCG (Procedural Content Generation) system. This component was specifically mentioned in PROCEDURAL.md but was not previously implemented.

## Implementation Details

### Core Functionality
- **ObjectiveGenerator**: Main struct for generating quest objectives
- **GenerateKillObjective**: Creates kill/defeat objectives with difficulty-based enemy selection
- **GenerateFetchObjective**: Creates item retrieval objectives with level-appropriate items
- **GenerateExploreObjective**: Creates exploration objectives with area discovery requirements

### Key Features
1. **Deterministic Generation**: Uses PCG seed management for reproducible results
2. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive parameter validation with descriptive error messages
3. **Level Scaling**: Adjusts content difficulty based on player level and quest difficulty
4. **Location Management**: Handles pickup/delivery locations and area assignments
5. **Quantity Logic**: Smart quantity calculation for different objective types

### Enemy Types by Difficulty
- **Level 1-3**: Rat, Goblin, Skeleton, Orc, Wolf, Zombie
- **Level 4-6**: Hobgoblin, Bear, Ghoul, Ogre, Wight, Owlbear  
- **Level 7-10**: Troll, Wraith, Manticore, Hill Giant, Spectre, Chimera
- **Level 10**: Titan, Archdevil, Legendary Dragon

### Item Types by Level
- **Level 1-3**: Basic gear (Iron Sword, Leather Armor, Health Potion)
- **Level 4-6**: Improved equipment (Steel Sword, Chain Mail, Magic Scroll)
- **Level 7-10**: Enchanted items (Enchanted Sword, Plate Armor, Elixir)
- **Level 11-15**: Magic items (Magic Weapon, Enchanted Armor, Rare Potion)
- **Level 16-20**: Legendary items (Legendary Weapon, Artifact Armor, Divine Elixir)

## Test Coverage
- **Coverage**: 88.8% (exceeds project requirement of >80%)
- **Test Types**: Table-driven tests with comprehensive edge case coverage
- **Test Categories**:
  - Unit tests for all public methods
  - Parameter validation tests
  - Deterministic generation verification
  - Helper function validation

## Integration
- Follows existing PCG patterns and conventions
- Integrates with PCG GenerationContext and seed management
- Uses proper PCG QuestObjective type definitions
- Compatible with existing quest generation system

## Quality Assurance
- ✅ Compilation: No build errors
- ✅ Testing: All tests passing (100% pass rate)
- ✅ Code Style: Follows Go and project conventions
- ✅ Documentation: Comprehensive inline documentation
- ✅ Thread Safety: No shared mutable state
- ✅ Error Handling: Proper error messages and validation

## Files Modified
1. **New**: `/pkg/pcg/quests/objectives.go` - Main implementation
2. **New**: `/pkg/pcg/quests/objectives_test.go` - Comprehensive test suite  
3. **Updated**: `/pkg/pcg/PROCEDURAL.md` - Documentation status update

## Workflow Followed
1. ✅ **Analyzed** existing codebase and identified missing component
2. ✅ **Compiled** baseline to establish clean starting state
3. ✅ **Implemented** objectives.go with full functionality
4. ✅ **Fixed** compilation errors and type mismatches
5. ✅ **Created** comprehensive test suite
6. ✅ **Verified** all tests pass with good coverage (88.8%)
7. ✅ **Validated** no regressions in existing tests
8. ✅ **Updated** documentation to reflect completion
9. ✅ **Confirmed** final build and test success

This implementation successfully completes one of the unimplemented components from the PCG roadmap, following the strict compile-test-document workflow as requested.
