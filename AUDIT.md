## DETAILED FINDINGS

### CRITICAL BUG: Character HP/MaxHP Not Properly Initialized in All Paths
**File:** pkg/game/character_creation.go:175-194
**Severity:** High
**Description:** The buildBaseCharacter function creates Character structs without initializing HP and MaxHP fields, leaving them at zero values. While calculateDerivedStats is called later in the creation flow to set these values, any code path that creates Characters directly using this function will result in characters with 0 HP.
**Expected Behavior:** All newly created characters should have proper HP and MaxHP values based on their class and constitution
**Actual Behavior:** Characters created via buildBaseCharacter have HP=0 and MaxHP=0 until calculateDerivedStats is explicitly called
**Impact:** Characters could be created in an invalid state with 0 HP, causing game-breaking bugs if they bypass the proper creation flow
**Reproduction:** Call buildBaseCharacter directly without calling calculateDerivedStats
**Code Reference:**
```go
func (cc *CharacterCreator) buildBaseCharacter(config CharacterCreationConfig, attributes map[string]int) *Character {
	return &Character{
		ID:           NewUID(),
		Name:         config.Name,
		// ... other fields initialized
		// HP and MaxHP are missing here - left as zero values
		Equipment:    make(map[EquipmentSlot]Item),
		Inventory:    []Item{},
		Gold:         config.StartingGold,
		active:       true,
		tags:         []string{"player_character"},
	}
}
```

### CRITICAL BUG: Spatial Index Data Corruption on Object Removal
**File:** pkg/game/spatial_index.go:232-242
**Severity:** High
**Description:** The removeNode function uses an unsafe removal technique that can corrupt object ordering. It replaces the removed object with the last element and truncates the slice, which changes the relative positions of objects in the spatial index and could affect subsequent queries.
**Expected Behavior:** Object removal should maintain the integrity and consistent ordering of remaining objects in the spatial index
**Actual Behavior:** Object removal swaps the removed object with the last element, potentially changing query results for overlapping spatial queries
**Impact:** Spatial queries may return inconsistent results after object removals, leading to game objects appearing or disappearing unpredictably
**Reproduction:** Insert multiple objects in a spatial region, remove one from the middle, then query the same region multiple times
**Code Reference:**
```go
func (si *SpatialIndex) removeNode(node *SpatialNode, objectID string) error {
	if node.isLeaf {
		for i, obj := range node.objects {
			if obj.GetID() == objectID {
				// This swap-and-truncate approach corrupts ordering
				node.objects[i] = node.objects[len(node.objects)-1]
				node.objects = node.objects[:len(node.objects)-1]
				return nil
			}
		}
	}
}
```

### MISSING FEATURE: NPC Management System Not Implemented
**File:** Documentation claims "Object and NPC management" but no NPC-specific implementation exists
**Severity:** High
**Description:** The README.md documents "Object and NPC management" as a core feature of the World Management system, but there are no NPC-specific types, management systems, or AI behaviors implemented in the codebase. Only generic GameObject interface exists.
**Expected Behavior:** System should include NPC-specific types, AI behaviors, dialogue systems, and NPC lifecycle management as documented
**Actual Behavior:** No NPC-specific functionality exists - only generic GameObject interface and Player types
**Impact:** Major advertised functionality is completely missing, making the system unsuitable for RPG scenarios requiring NPCs
**Reproduction:** Search codebase for NPC-related types or management - none exist beyond interface definitions
**Code Reference:**
```go
// No NPC-specific types found - only generic GameObject interface
type GameObject interface {
	GetID() string
	GetName() string
	// ... generic methods only
}
```

### FUNCTIONAL MISMATCH: Turn-Based Combat Action Point Validation Incomplete
**File:** pkg/server/handlers.go:174-191
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** The handleMove function validates action points but doesn't properly validate against the documented action point system. The documentation states "2 points per turn, 1 for move, 1 for attack/spell" but the validation only checks if ActionPoints > 0, not if the specific action cost can be afforded.
**Expected Behavior:** Should validate that player has exactly ActionCostMove (1) action points available before allowing movement
**Actual Behavior:** Only checks if ActionPoints > 0, allowing movement even with insufficient action points for the documented cost system
**Impact:** Players could potentially move with insufficient action points, breaking the turn-based combat balance
**Reproduction:** Set player ActionPoints to any value > 0 but < ActionCostMove and attempt to move
**Code Reference:**
```go
func (s *RPCServer) consumeMovementActionPoints(player *game.Player) error {
	character := player.GetCharacter()
	
	// Should validate against ActionCostMove constant, not just > 0
	if character.ActionPoints <= 0 {
		return fmt.Errorf("insufficient action points for movement")
	}
	
	character.SetActionPoints(character.ActionPoints - 1)
	return nil
}
```

### FUNCTIONAL MISMATCH: WebSocket Origin Validation Production Logic Flawed
**File:** pkg/server/websocket.go:59-89
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** The getAllowedOrigins function has conflicting logic for production vs development mode. The comment warns against changing defaults but the production behavior depends on WEBSOCKET_ALLOWED_ORIGINS being set, with no clear fallback for production environments that don't set this variable.
**Expected Behavior:** Production deployments should have secure defaults for origin validation without requiring environment variables
**Actual Behavior:** Production mode defaults to development origins if WEBSOCKET_ALLOWED_ORIGINS is not set, potentially allowing unauthorized origins
**Impact:** Security vulnerability in production deployments that don't explicitly configure allowed origins
**Reproduction:** Deploy in production mode without setting WEBSOCKET_ALLOWED_ORIGINS environment variable
**Code Reference:**
```go
func (s *RPCServer) getAllowedOrigins() []string {
	origins := os.Getenv("WEBSOCKET_ALLOWED_ORIGINS")
	if origins == "" {
		// This fallback to dev origins is dangerous in production
		hosts := make(map[string]string)
		hosts["localhost"] = "localhost"
		hosts["127.0.0.1"] = "127.0.0.1"
		// ... creates dev origins even in production
	}
}
```

### FUNCTIONAL MISMATCH: Effect Stacking Logic Contradicts Documentation
**File:** pkg/game/effectmanager.go:293-340
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** The AllowsStacking method and effect application logic allows unlimited stacking for certain effect types, but the documentation mentions "Effect stacking and priority management" suggesting there should be limits or priority-based resolution.
**Expected Behavior:** Effect stacking should have limits and priority-based management as documented
**Actual Behavior:** Effects that allow stacking can stack infinitely without any limit or priority consideration
**Impact:** Game balance could be broken by unlimited effect stacking (e.g., unlimited damage over time effects)
**Reproduction:** Apply multiple instances of EffectDamageOverTime to the same character - they stack without limit
**Code Reference:**
```go
func (et EffectType) AllowsStacking() bool {
	switch et {
	case EffectDamageOverTime, EffectHealOverTime, EffectStatBoost:
		return true // No limits on stacking implemented
	default:
		return false
	}
}
```

### MISSING FEATURE: Event Broadcasting to WebSocket Clients Not Implemented
**File:** Multiple files reference event broadcasting but implementation is incomplete
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** The README.md documents "Real-time event broadcasting" as a key WebSocket feature, and the code has WebSocketBroadcaster and event system components, but there's no actual connection between the game event system and WebSocket message broadcasting to clients.
**Expected Behavior:** Game events should be automatically broadcast to connected WebSocket clients for real-time updates
**Actual Behavior:** Events are created and handled internally but never broadcast to WebSocket clients
**Impact:** Real-time multiplayer functionality is non-functional - clients won't receive live game updates
**Reproduction:** Connect via WebSocket, trigger game events (movement, combat) - no events are broadcast to clients
**Code Reference:**
```go
// GameEvent system exists but no WebSocket integration
type GameEvent struct {
	Type      EventType              `yaml:"event_type"`
	SourceID  string                 `yaml:"source_id"`
	// ... but no automatic WebSocket broadcasting
}
```

### EDGE CASE BUG: Session Reference Counting Race Condition
**File:** pkg/server/session.go:71-75
**Severity:** Low
**Description:** The getOrCreateSession function calls addRef() on sessions but there's no corresponding cleanup mechanism for reference counting, and the reference counting is not atomic, potentially leading to race conditions in concurrent session access.
**Expected Behavior:** Reference counting should be atomic and properly paired with cleanup to prevent memory leaks
**Actual Behavior:** Non-atomic reference counting with no cleanup mechanism
**Impact:** Potential memory leaks and race conditions in high-concurrency scenarios with many simultaneous sessions
**Reproduction:** Create multiple concurrent sessions with rapid creation/destruction cycles
**Code Reference:**
```go
session.addRef() // Non-atomic reference counting
s.sessions[sessionID] = session
// No corresponding cleanup or atomic operations
```
