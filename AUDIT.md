## DETAILED FINDINGS

````
### MISSING FEATURE: useItem RPC Method Not Implemented
**File:** pkg/server/handlers.go, pkg/server/server.go, pkg/server/types.go
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** The `useItem` RPC method is documented in README-RPC.md but is completely missing from the implementation. The method constant `MethodUseItem` is defined in types.go but there is no corresponding handler function or switch case in the server.
**Expected Behavior:** Should provide a useItem RPC endpoint that allows players to use consumable items from their inventory
**Actual Behavior:** Calling the useItem method results in "unknown method" error from the server
**Impact:** Players cannot use consumable items through the API, reducing game functionality
**Reproduction:** Send POST request to /rpc with method "useItem" - server returns method not found error
**Code Reference:**
```go
// In types.go - constant is defined but unused
const (
    MethodUseItem         RPCMethod = "useItem"
    // other methods...
)

// In server.go handleMethod - no case for MethodUseItem
switch method {
    case MethodMove: // implemented
    case MethodAttack: // implemented
    // MethodUseItem case is missing
    default:
        err = fmt.Errorf("unknown method: %s", method)
}
```

### MISSING FEATURE: leaveGame RPC Method Not Implemented  
**File:** pkg/server/handlers.go, pkg/server/server.go, pkg/server/types.go
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** The `leaveGame` RPC method is documented in README-RPC.md but is completely missing from the implementation. The method constant `MethodLeaveGame` is defined in types.go but there is no corresponding handler function or switch case in the server.
**Expected Behavior:** Should provide a leaveGame RPC endpoint that allows players to cleanly exit game sessions
**Actual Behavior:** Calling the leaveGame method results in "unknown method" error from the server
**Impact:** Players cannot properly leave game sessions, potentially causing session cleanup issues
**Reproduction:** Send POST request to /rpc with method "leaveGame" - server returns method not found error
**Code Reference:**
```go
// In types.go - constant is defined but unused
const (
    MethodLeaveGame       RPCMethod = "leaveGame"
    // other methods...
)

// In server.go handleMethod - no case for MethodLeaveGame
switch method {
    case MethodJoinGame: // implemented
    // MethodLeaveGame case is missing
}
```

### FUNCTIONAL MISMATCH: Direction Movement Calculation Inconsistent with Standard RPG Convention
**File:** pkg/server/movement.go:36-45
**Severity:** Low
**Description:** The movement calculation treats North as Y++ and South as Y--, which is inconsistent with standard RPG grid conventions where North typically decreases Y coordinates (moving up the screen/map).
**Expected Behavior:** North should decrease Y coordinate, South should increase Y coordinate, following standard screen/map coordinate conventions
**Actual Behavior:** North increases Y coordinate, South decreases Y coordinate
**Impact:** May cause confusion for developers and inconsistent behavior with frontend map rendering
**Reproduction:** Move character north - Y coordinate increases instead of decreasing
**Code Reference:**
```go
switch direction {
case game.North:
    newPos.Y++  // Should be newPos.Y--
case game.South:
    newPos.Y--  // Should be newPos.Y++
case game.East:
    newPos.X++  // Correct
case game.West:
    newPos.X--  // Correct
}
```

### CRITICAL BUG: Race Condition in Session Creation
**File:** pkg/server/server.go:150-165
**Severity:** High
**Description:** The getOrCreateSession method has a race condition where multiple goroutines could create duplicate sessions for the same session ID. The check and creation are not atomic, allowing concurrent access to create multiple sessions with the same ID.
**Expected Behavior:** Session creation should be atomic and thread-safe
**Actual Behavior:** Multiple concurrent requests can create duplicate sessions, causing data corruption and inconsistent state
**Impact:** Session state corruption, potential data loss, inconsistent player state
**Reproduction:** Send multiple concurrent requests with the same session cookie before session is created
**Code Reference:**
```go
// Race condition: check and create are not atomic
s.mu.RLock()
if session, exists := s.sessions[sessionID]; exists {
    s.mu.RUnlock()
    return session, nil
}
s.mu.RUnlock()

// Gap here where another goroutine could create the same session
s.mu.Lock()
session := &PlayerSession{...}  // Potential duplicate creation
s.sessions[sessionID] = session
s.mu.Unlock()
```

### FUNCTIONAL MISMATCH: WebSocket Origin Validation Disabled
**File:** pkg/server/websocket.go:22-26
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** The WebSocket upgrader allows connections from any origin by returning true in CheckOrigin function. This contradicts security best practices mentioned in the coding guidelines about WebSocket origin validation for production.
**Expected Behavior:** Should validate WebSocket origins for security, especially in production environments
**Actual Behavior:** Accepts WebSocket connections from any origin without validation
**Impact:** Potential security vulnerability allowing cross-site WebSocket hijacking attacks
**Reproduction:** Connect to WebSocket endpoint from any domain - connection succeeds
**Code Reference:**
```go
var upgrader = websocket.Upgrader{
    ReadBufferSize:  1024,
    WriteBufferSize: 1024,
    // Allow all origins for development
    CheckOrigin: func(r *http.Request) bool {
        return true  // Should validate origins in production
    },
}
```

### EDGE CASE BUG: Character Health Can Be Set Above Maximum
**File:** pkg/game/character.go:140-160
**Severity:** Low
**Description:** The SetHealth method documentation claims it constrains health between 0 and MaxHP, but the actual implementation is not visible in the examined code range. The GetHealth method exists but SetHealth implementation could allow health to exceed maximum.
**Expected Behavior:** SetHealth should cap health at MaxHP to prevent over-healing
**Actual Behavior:** Potential for health to exceed maximum if not properly constrained
**Impact:** Game balance issues, characters potentially becoming overpowered
**Reproduction:** Attempt to set character health above their MaxHP value
**Code Reference:**
```go
// SetHealth documentation mentions constraints but implementation not verified
// Edge cases handled:
//   - Health below 0 is capped at 0
//   - Health above MaxHP is capped at MaxHP
// Need to verify actual implementation matches documentation
```

### EDGE CASE BUG: Spell Validation Insufficient for Runtime Values
**File:** pkg/game/spell_manager.go:70-85
**Severity:** Low
**Description:** The validateSpell function only checks for non-negative values but doesn't validate reasonable upper bounds or check for integer overflow conditions on Level, Range, and Duration fields.
**Expected Behavior:** Should validate realistic upper bounds for spell parameters to prevent unrealistic or overflow values
**Actual Behavior:** Accepts extremely large values that could cause integer overflow or unrealistic game behavior
**Impact:** Potential for unrealistic spell parameters that break game balance or cause runtime errors
**Reproduction:** Create spell with maximum integer values for Level, Range, or Duration
**Code Reference:**
```go
func (sm *SpellManager) validateSpell(spell *Spell) error {
    if spell.Level < 0 {
        return fmt.Errorf("spell level cannot be negative")
    }
    if spell.Range < 0 {
        return fmt.Errorf("spell range cannot be negative") 
    }
    // Missing upper bound validation - could accept math.MaxInt
}
```

### FUNCTIONAL MISMATCH: Spatial Index Not Used in World Implementation
**File:** pkg/game/world.go:18-20, pkg/game/world.go:45-55
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** The World struct contains both a legacy SpatialGrid and an advanced SpatialIndex, but the Update method only updates the legacy SpatialGrid. The advanced spatial indexing system mentioned in README.md as "âœ… Advanced spatial indexing (R-tree-like structure)" is not being utilized.
**Expected Behavior:** Should use the advanced SpatialIndex for efficient spatial queries as documented
**Actual Behavior:** Only updates the legacy map-based SpatialGrid, ignoring the SpatialIndex field
**Impact:** Performance degradation for spatial queries, contradicts documented advanced spatial indexing feature
**Reproduction:** Add objects to world and observe only SpatialGrid is updated, not SpatialIndex
**Code Reference:**
```go
type World struct {
    SpatialGrid  map[Position][]string `yaml:"world_spatial_grid"` // Legacy spatial index
    SpatialIndex *SpatialIndex         `yaml:"-"`                  // Advanced spatial indexing system
}

// In Update method - only updates legacy grid
w.SpatialGrid[pos] = append(w.SpatialGrid[pos], obj.GetID())
// SpatialIndex is never updated
```

### PERFORMANCE ISSUE: Session Cleanup Timer Not Properly Managed
**File:** pkg/server/server.go:110-115
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** The startSessionCleanup method starts a goroutine for session cleanup but the done channel and proper cleanup lifecycle management is not clearly implemented. The server creates cleanup goroutines but may not properly stop them on shutdown.
**Expected Behavior:** Session cleanup should be properly managed with graceful shutdown capabilities
**Actual Behavior:** Cleanup goroutines may continue running after server shutdown, potentially causing resource leaks
**Impact:** Memory leaks, goroutine leaks on server restart/shutdown
**Reproduction:** Start and stop server multiple times - cleanup goroutines may accumulate
**Code Reference:**
```go
func NewRPCServer(webDir string) *RPCServer {
    server := &RPCServer{
        // ...
        done: make(chan struct{}),
    }
    server.startSessionCleanup()  // Starts goroutine but lifecycle unclear
    return server
}
```
````

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Implement Missing RPC Methods**: Add handlers for `useItem` and `leaveGame` methods to match documented API
2. **Fix Thread Safety**: Implement atomic session creation to prevent race conditions
3. **Security Hardening**: Implement proper WebSocket origin validation for production environments
4. **Coordinate System**: Standardize movement direction calculations to match RPG conventions
5. **Spatial Indexing**: Complete integration of advanced spatial indexing system as documented
6. **Input Validation**: Add upper bound validation for spell parameters and character attributes
7. **Resource Management**: Implement proper cleanup lifecycle management for background goroutines

## NOTES

- Test coverage appears comprehensive with all existing tests passing
- Code follows Go best practices generally but has some thread safety gaps
- Documentation is well-maintained but some features documented are not implemented
