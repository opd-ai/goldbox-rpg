## AUDIT SUMMARY

- CRITICAL BUG: 0
- FUNCTIONAL MISMATCH: 0
- MISSING FEATURE: 2
- EDGE CASE BUG: 1
- PERFORMANCE ISSUE: 0

**Notes:**  
- Dependency analysis was performed: Level 0 files (constants.go, types.go, modifier.go, utils.go, tile.go) were audited first, followed by Level 1+ files as needed.
- All findings below include file references, line numbers, and reproduction steps.

### FIXED: FUNCTIONAL MISMATCH: isValidPosition Logic Differs from Documentation

**File:** pkg/game/utils.go:27-36  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Description:**  
The `isValidPosition` function now checks for both non-negative coordinates and upper bounds based on map/level size constraints. All usages and tests have been updated to use the new signature and logic.  
**Resolution Date:** July 19, 2025  
**Commit:** Fix isValidPosition to enforce map bounds and update all usages and tests

### MISSING FEATURE: No Enforcement of Thread Safety in Utility Functions

**File:** pkg/game/utils.go (all utility functions)  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Description:**  
The README and project guidelines require thread safety for all state-modifying operations. While core game state is protected, utility functions (e.g., `calculateLevel`, `calculateHealthGain`, etc.) are not documented as thread-safe and do not use mutexes.  
**Expected Behavior:**  
All functions that could be called concurrently or modify shared state should be explicitly thread-safe or documented as such.  
**Actual Behavior:**  
Utility functions are pure, but this is not documented, and future modifications could introduce unsafe behavior.  
**Impact:**  
Potential for future concurrency bugs if these functions are modified to access shared state.  
**Reproduction:**  
N/A (potential issue for future code changes).  
**Code Reference:**
```go
// Example: calculateLevel, calculateHealthGain, etc. (no mutex, no thread-safety doc)
```

### MISSING FEATURE: No Upper Bound Checks in NewUID

**File:** pkg/game/utils.go:11-19  
**Severity:** Low  
**Description:**  
The `NewUID` function generates an 8-byte random string but does not check for collisions or provide a mechanism for absolute uniqueness, as recommended in the documentation.  
**Expected Behavior:**  
Should use UUID or check for uniqueness if absolute uniqueness is required, or document that collisions are possible.  
**Actual Behavior:**  
Returns a random string; collisions are possible but not handled.  
**Impact:**  
Possible (though rare) identifier collisions in large games.  
**Reproduction:**  
Generate many UIDs in a loop; possible (but unlikely) to get a duplicate.  
**Code Reference:**
```go
func NewUID() string {
	b := make([]byte, 8)
	rand.Read(b)
	return hex.EncodeToString(b)
}
```

### EDGE CASE BUG: calculateMaxActionPoints Allows Level < 1

**File:** pkg/game/utils.go:163-180  
**Severity:** Low  
**Description:**  
The function clamps level to 1 if less than 1, but this is not documented in the function comment, and may mask bugs elsewhere.  
**Expected Behavior:**  
Should return an error or panic if level < 1, or document the clamping behavior.  
**Actual Behavior:**  
Silently clamps level to 1, which may hide logic errors in calling code.  
**Impact:**  
Potential for silent logic errors if invalid levels are passed.  
**Reproduction:**  
Call `calculateMaxActionPoints(0, 10)`; returns as if level 1.  
**Code Reference:**
```go
func calculateMaxActionPoints(level, dexterity int) int {
	if level < 1 {
		level = 1
	}
	// ...existing code...
}
```
