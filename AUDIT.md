## DETAILED FINDINGS

~~~~
### MISSING FEATURE: PCG Template YAML File Loading Not Implemented [RESOLVED]
**File:** pkg/pcg/items/templates.go:102-106
**Severity:** Medium
**Status:** RESOLVED (commit e418c07, August 20, 2025)
**Description:** The LoadFromFile method for loading PCG item templates from YAML files is documented as implemented but contains only a TODO comment and fallback to default templates.
**Expected Behavior:** According to README.md and code documentation, PCG system should load templates from YAML files under data/ directory for template-based item generation
**Actual Behavior:** Function ignores the configPath parameter and only loads hardcoded default templates with a TODO comment
**Impact:** Users cannot customize item generation templates via YAML configuration files as documented, limiting PCG flexibility
**Resolution:** Implemented complete YAML file loading functionality with:
- Support for loading custom item templates from YAML files
- Support for loading custom rarity modifiers
- Proper error handling for file not found, invalid YAML, and validation errors
- Fallback to default templates when file is empty or contains no templates
- Added TemplateCollection struct to define expected YAML format
- Comprehensive test coverage including edge cases and integration tests
**Regression Test:** Test_PCG_Template_YAML_Loading_Bug in templates_yaml_loading_bug_test.go
**Code Reference:**
```go
// LoadFromFile loads templates from YAML file
func (itr *ItemTemplateRegistry) LoadFromFile(configPath string) error {
	// TODO: Implement YAML file loading
	// For now, just ensure default templates are loaded
	return itr.LoadDefaultTemplates()
}
```

### FUNCTIONAL MISMATCH: Character Classes Missing Documentation-Implementation Gap [RESOLVED]
**File:** pkg/game/classes.go:30-38  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Status:** RESOLVED (commit 69f2afb, August 20, 2025)  
**Description:** String() method for CharacterClass hardcodes class names in array but documentation claims classes are "defined as constants using this type"  
**Expected Behavior:** README.md states "Class-based system (Fighter, Mage, Cleric, Thief, Ranger, Paladin)" suggesting these should be properly enumerated  
**Actual Behavior:** String() method uses hardcoded array index access which will panic for invalid enum values  
**Impact:** Invalid CharacterClass values cause panics instead of graceful error handling  
**Resolution:** Modified String() method to validate bounds before array access and return "Unknown" for invalid values. This prevents panics while maintaining backward compatibility for valid enum values.  
**Regression Test:** Test_CharacterClass_String_Panic_Bug in character_class_panic_bug_test.go  
**Code Reference:**
```go
func (cc CharacterClass) String() string {
	return [...]string{
		"Fighter",
		"Mage", 
		"Cleric",
		"Thief",
		"Ranger",
		"Paladin",
	}[cc] // Will panic if cc >= 6
}
```

### CRITICAL BUG: Spatial Index Bounds Check Missing [RESOLVED]
**File:** pkg/game/spatial_index.go:41-46  
**Severity:** High  
**Status:** RESOLVED (commit 818bcce, August 20, 2025)  
**Description:** The spatial index Insert method checks if object position is within bounds but the contains method implementation is not shown, and there's potential for out-of-bounds access  
**Expected Behavior:** Spatial indexing should gracefully handle all position inputs and provide error feedback for invalid positions  
**Actual Behavior:** Insert method assumes contains() works correctly but error handling may be incomplete  
**Impact:** Could cause panics or incorrect spatial queries if bounds checking is faulty  
**Resolution:** Fixed three issues:
1. Corrected bounds calculation in NewSpatialIndex to use width-1, height-1
2. Added bounds validation to GetObjectsAt method 
3. Added bounds validation to Update method
4. Removed incorrect SetPosition call from Update method
**Regression Test:** Test_SpatialIndex_BoundsCheck_Bug in spatial_index_bounds_bug_test.go
**Code Reference:**
```go
func (si *SpatialIndex) Insert(obj GameObject) error {
	si.mu.Lock()
	defer si.mu.Unlock()

	pos := obj.GetPosition()
	if !si.contains(si.bounds, pos) {
		return fmt.Errorf("object position %v is outside spatial index bounds", pos)
	}
	// contains() method implementation not visible in code review
}
```

### MISSING FEATURE: WebSocket Origin Validation Production Mode - FIXED
**File:** README.md vs actual server implementation
**Severity:** High - RESOLVED
**Status:** FIXED in commit [PENDING]
**Description:** README.md explicitly states "WebSocket origin validation must be enabled for production" and mentions WEBSOCKET_ALLOWED_ORIGINS environment variable, but actual implementation was not using this environment variable
**Expected Behavior:** Production deployments should enforce WebSocket origin validation using WEBSOCKET_ALLOWED_ORIGINS environment variable
**Actual Behavior:** WebSocket upgrader was using Config.AllowedOrigins (from ALLOWED_ORIGINS env var) instead of documented WEBSOCKET_ALLOWED_ORIGINS
**Impact:** Security vulnerability in production - unauthorized origins could connect to WebSocket endpoints
**Reproduction:** Deploy in production without origin validation and attempt cross-origin WebSocket connections
**Fix Applied:** 
- Modified `pkg/server/websocket.go` upgrader CheckOrigin function to use `getAllowedOrigins()` method
- Updated `getAllowedOrigins()` to fall back to Config.AllowedOrigins when WEBSOCKET_ALLOWED_ORIGINS is not set
- Added regression test `TestWebSocketOriginValidation_WebSocketAllowedOriginsBug` to validate the fix
**Code Reference:**
Documentation states: "export WEBSOCKET_ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://yourdomain.com,https://www.yourdomain.com"" - now properly implemented
Fixed in files: pkg/server/websocket.go, pkg/server/websocket_allowed_origins_fix_test.go

### EDGE CASE BUG: Effect System Concurrent Access Pattern [FALSE POSITIVE]
**File:** pkg/game/character.go:63-66, pkg/game/effects.go:68-92
**Severity:** Medium
**Status:** FALSE POSITIVE (August 20, 2025)
**Description:** Character struct has EffectManager field marked as `yaml:"-"` suggesting it's not serialized, but concurrent access patterns for effect management may have race conditions
**Expected Behavior:** All effect operations should be thread-safe with proper mutex protection as stated in coding guidelines
**Actual Behavior:** EffectManager concurrent access safety not clearly protected in Character methods
**Impact:** Race conditions in effect application/removal during concurrent game operations
**Resolution:** Upon investigation, the concurrent access pattern is properly implemented:
- Character struct has proper mutex protection (`sync.RWMutex`) for all EffectManager access
- EffectManager struct has its own internal mutex (`sync.RWMutex`) for thread safety
- All Character methods (AddEffect, RemoveEffect, HasEffect, GetEffects, GetStats) properly use Character's mutex
- All EffectManager methods properly use their own internal mutex
**Analysis:** The audit concern was unfounded - both levels of mutex protection exist and are correctly used throughout the codebase. Thread safety test `TestEffectManager_ThreadSafety` in `effectimmunity_test.go` confirms concurrent operations work correctly.
**Code Reference:**
```go
type Character struct {
	mu          sync.RWMutex `yaml:"-"`
	// ... other fields ...
	EffectManager *EffectManager `yaml:"-"` // Thread-safe with dual mutex protection
}

type EffectManager struct {
	// ... other fields ...
	mu              sync.RWMutex  // Internal thread safety
}
```

### FUNCTIONAL MISMATCH: Comprehensive Effect System Documentation Gap [FALSE POSITIVE]
**File:** pkg/game/effects.go:40-92 vs README.md claims
**Severity:** Medium  
**Status:** FALSE POSITIVE (August 20, 2025)
**Description:** README.md claims "Comprehensive Effect System" with "Effect stacking and priority management" and "Immunity and resistance handling" but actual Effect struct shows basic structure without clear stacking/priority logic
**Expected Behavior:** Effect system should have visible stacking rules, priority management, and immunity system
**Actual Behavior:** Effect struct has Stacks field but stacking logic, priority resolution, and immunity handling not evident in core structure
**Impact:** Developers cannot rely on documented advanced effect features
**Resolution:** Upon investigation, all documented effect system features are properly implemented:
- **Effect Stacking**: `AllowsStacking()` method controls stacking behavior for different effect types; stacking logic in `applyEffectInternal()` method
- **Priority Management**: `DispelInfo.Priority` field with priority constants (`DispelPriorityLowest` to `DispelPriorityHighest`); `DispelEffects()` sorts by priority
- **Immunity and Resistance**: Complete immunity system in `effectimmunity.go` with `ImmunityType` constants, `AddImmunity()`, `CheckImmunity()` methods, resistance multipliers (0-1), and both temporary/permanent immunity support
**Analysis:** The audit was based on examining only the basic Effect struct definition. The comprehensive effect features are distributed across multiple files (`effectmanager.go`, `effectimmunity.go`, `effectbehavior.go`) and are fully functional with extensive test coverage.
**Code Reference:**
```go
// Effect stacking implementation
func (et EffectType) AllowsStacking() bool {
    case EffectDamageOverTime, EffectHealOverTime, EffectStatBoost:
        return true // These effect types can stack
}

// Priority-based dispel system
type DispelInfo struct {
    Priority  DispelPriority  // Dispel priority (0-100)
    Types     []DispelType    // Types that can dispel this effect
    Removable bool           // Whether effect can be dispelled
}

// Immunity and resistance system
type EffectManager struct {
    immunities     map[EffectType]*ImmunityData  // Permanent immunities
    tempImmunities map[EffectType]*ImmunityData  // Temporary immunities  
    resistances    map[EffectType]float64        // Resistance multipliers
}
```

### CRITICAL BUG: Handler Method Registration Incomplete [FALSE POSITIVE]
**File:** pkg/server/constants.go:41-79 vs pkg/server/handlers.go  
**Severity:** High  
**Status:** FALSE POSITIVE (August 20, 2025)  
**Description:** Constants define 25+ RPC methods but actual handler implementations found only cover partial set, with some methods potentially unregistered  
**Expected Behavior:** All documented RPC methods should have corresponding handler implementations and be registered in server  
**Actual Behavior:** Method constants exist (MethodUseItem, MethodApplyEffect, etc.) but not all have corresponding handler implementations verified  
**Impact:** JSON-RPC calls to unimplemented methods will fail, breaking documented API surface  
**Resolution:** Upon investigation, all 37 RPC method constants have corresponding handler functions implemented and properly registered in the handleMethod switch statement. Build succeeds and routing works correctly.  
**Analysis:** The audit was likely written when some handlers were missing but have since been implemented. Current state shows complete coverage:
- 37 RPC method constants defined in constants.go
- 37 corresponding handler functions in handlers.go  
- 37 case statements in server.go handleMethod switch
**Code Reference:**
```go
// Constants defined but handlers not all verified:
MethodUseItem         RPCMethod = "useItem"
MethodApplyEffect     RPCMethod = "applyEffect" 
// ... 25+ methods total but not all have handleMethodName implementations
```

### PERFORMANCE ISSUE: Spatial Query Efficiency Claims [FALSE POSITIVE]
**File:** pkg/game/spatial_index.go:67-85 vs README.md
**Severity:** Low
**Status:** FALSE POSITIVE (August 20, 2025)
**Description:** README.md claims "Advanced spatial indexing (R-tree-like structure for efficient queries)" but implementation shows basic rectangular bounds checking
**Expected Behavior:** True R-tree implementation with hierarchical spatial partitioning for O(log n) queries
**Actual Behavior:** Implementation appears to use simpler spatial grid or basic bounds checking rather than true R-tree structure
**Impact:** Spatial queries may not scale efficiently for large numbers of game objects
**Resolution:** Upon investigation, the implementation IS actually an R-tree-like structure as documented:
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Uses `SpatialNode` with children forming a tree hierarchy, not a flat grid
- **Dynamic Splitting**: Nodes automatically split when containing >8 objects using quadtree-style partitioning  
- **Tree Traversal**: Query operations use recursive tree traversal with bounding box pruning
- **Spatial Optimization**: Queries use bounding rectangle intersection tests to skip irrelevant subtrees
- **Performance Characteristics**: O(log n) average case for spatial queries, significantly better than linear search
**Analysis:** The implementation is a **quadtree variant** rather than a pure R-tree, but this is appropriate for game engines and delivers the promised performance characteristics. The README.md accurately states "R-tree-**like**" rather than claiming to be a full R-tree implementation. The spatial index provides efficient spatial queries suitable for game world management.
**Code Reference:**
```go
// Hierarchical tree structure with dynamic splitting
type SpatialNode struct {
    bounds   Rectangle
    objects  []GameObject
    children []*SpatialNode  // Tree hierarchy for O(log n) queries
    isLeaf   bool
}

// Efficient query traversal with bounding box pruning
func (si *SpatialIndex) queryNode(node *SpatialNode, rect Rectangle, result *[]GameObject) {
    if !si.intersects(node.bounds, rect) {
        return // Prune irrelevant subtrees
    }
    // Recursive traversal of relevant children only
}
```

### FUNCTIONAL MISMATCH: Health Check Implementation Scope [FIXED]
**File:** pkg/server/health.go:44-52 vs README.md claims
**Severity:** Low
**Status:** FIXED (August 21, 2025)
**Description:** README.md states "Comprehensive health status with detailed checks" for /health endpoint, but health checker only registered 4 basic checks
**Expected Behavior:** Comprehensive health monitoring covering all major system components
**Actual Behavior (Previous):** Only 4 health checks registered: server, game_state, spell_manager, event_system - missing PCG, resilience, validation systems
**Impact:** Health monitoring didn't cover all documented system components
**Resolution:** Implemented comprehensive health checks covering all major subsystems:
- Added 6 additional health checks: pcg_manager, validation_system, circuit_breakers, metrics_system, configuration, performance_monitor
- Total health checks expanded from 4 to 10 comprehensive checks
- Each check validates subsystem initialization and functionality
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing health endpoints
- Added regression test `Test_HealthChecker_Comprehensive_Coverage` to prevent future regressions
**Fix Commit:** "Fix health check implementation scope bug"
**Code Reference (After Fix):**
```go
// Comprehensive health checks now implemented:
hc.RegisterCheck("server", hc.checkServer)
hc.RegisterCheck("game_state", hc.checkGameState)
hc.RegisterCheck("spell_manager", hc.checkSpellManager)
hc.RegisterCheck("event_system", hc.checkEventSystem)
// NEW comprehensive checks:
hc.RegisterCheck("pcg_manager", hc.checkPCGManager)
hc.RegisterCheck("validation_system", hc.checkValidationSystem)
hc.RegisterCheck("circuit_breakers", hc.checkCircuitBreakers)
hc.RegisterCheck("metrics_system", hc.checkMetricsSystem)
hc.RegisterCheck("configuration", hc.checkConfiguration)
hc.RegisterCheck("performance_monitor", hc.checkPerformanceMonitor)
```

### MISSING FEATURE: Character Creation Methods Implementation Gap [FIXED]
**File:** Character creation system vs README.md  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Status:** FIXED (August 22, 2025)  
**Description:** README.md documents "Multiple character creation methods: roll, standard array, point-buy, custom" but point-buy implementation had bug where it didn't consider class requirements  
**Expected Behavior:** Four distinct character creation methods should be implemented and accessible via API  
**Actual Behavior:** ✅ All four methods implemented. Point-buy method was not considering class requirements when allocating points, causing character creation failures.  
**Impact:** ❌ Users couldn't reliably use point-buy method for classes with attribute requirements  
**Fix Applied:** Modified `generatePointBuyAttributes()` in `pkg/game/character_creation.go` to:
- Accept class parameter to check requirements  
- Allocate points to meet minimum class requirements first  
- Use correct point cost calculation (2 points for attributes 13+)  
**Code Reference:**  
- Fixed: `pkg/game/character_creation.go:253` (method signature and class-aware allocation)  
- Test: `pkg/game/character_creation_methods_test.go` (comprehensive test for all 4 methods)  
- Verified: All methods ("roll", "standard", "pointbuy", "custom") now functional  
~~~~

## METHODOLOGY NOTES

This audit was conducted using dependency-level analysis, starting with core types and constants, progressing through game mechanics, server handlers, and integration points. All findings reference specific files and line numbers where issues were identified. The audit focused on functional correctness rather than code style or minor optimizations.

**Files Not Audited:** Test files, frontend TypeScript code, documentation files, and build scripts were excluded from functional audit scope.
