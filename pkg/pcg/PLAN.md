create a `pkg/pcg/PLAN.md` file which builds on the existing procedural content generation system in the `pkg/pcg/` package for goldbox-rpg. Examine both PROCEDURAL.md and the code itself to develop the plan. The goal is to advance from the existing procedural content generation to the ability to completely generate playable games with zero configuration. In the absence of a config file, the PCG should be used to generate a complete, playable game.
