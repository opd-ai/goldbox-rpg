## DETAILED FINDINGS

~~~~
### MISSING FEATURE: PCG Template YAML File Loading Not Implemented [RESOLVED]
**File:** pkg/pcg/items/templates.go:102-106
**Severity:** Medium
**Status:** RESOLVED (commit e418c07, August 20, 2025)
**Description:** The LoadFromFile method for loading PCG item templates from YAML files is documented as implemented but contains only a TODO comment and fallback to default templates.
**Expected Behavior:** According to README.md and code documentation, PCG system should load templates from YAML files under data/ directory for template-based item generation
**Actual Behavior:** Function ignores the configPath parameter and only loads hardcoded default templates with a TODO comment
**Impact:** Users cannot customize item generation templates via YAML configuration files as documented, limiting PCG flexibility
**Resolution:** Implemented complete YAML file loading functionality with:
- Support for loading custom item templates from YAML files
- Support for loading custom rarity modifiers
- Proper error handling for file not found, invalid YAML, and validation errors
- Fallback to default templates when file is empty or contains no templates
- Added TemplateCollection struct to define expected YAML format
- Comprehensive test coverage including edge cases and integration tests
**Regression Test:** Test_PCG_Template_YAML_Loading_Bug in templates_yaml_loading_bug_test.go
**Code Reference:**
```go
// LoadFromFile loads templates from YAML file
func (itr *ItemTemplateRegistry) LoadFromFile(configPath string) error {
	// TODO: Implement YAML file loading
	// For now, just ensure default templates are loaded
	return itr.LoadDefaultTemplates()
}
```

### FUNCTIONAL MISMATCH: Character Classes Missing Documentation-Implementation Gap [RESOLVED]
**File:** pkg/game/classes.go:30-38  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Status:** RESOLVED (commit 69f2afb, August 20, 2025)  
**Description:** String() method for CharacterClass hardcodes class names in array but documentation claims classes are "defined as constants using this type"  
**Expected Behavior:** README.md states "Class-based system (Fighter, Mage, Cleric, Thief, Ranger, Paladin)" suggesting these should be properly enumerated  
**Actual Behavior:** String() method uses hardcoded array index access which will panic for invalid enum values  
**Impact:** Invalid CharacterClass values cause panics instead of graceful error handling  
**Resolution:** Modified String() method to validate bounds before array access and return "Unknown" for invalid values. This prevents panics while maintaining backward compatibility for valid enum values.  
**Regression Test:** Test_CharacterClass_String_Panic_Bug in character_class_panic_bug_test.go  
**Code Reference:**
```go
func (cc CharacterClass) String() string {
	return [...]string{
		"Fighter",
		"Mage", 
		"Cleric",
		"Thief",
		"Ranger",
		"Paladin",
	}[cc] // Will panic if cc >= 6
}
```

### CRITICAL BUG: Spatial Index Bounds Check Missing [RESOLVED]
**File:** pkg/game/spatial_index.go:41-46  
**Severity:** High  
**Status:** RESOLVED (commit 818bcce, August 20, 2025)  
**Description:** The spatial index Insert method checks if object position is within bounds but the contains method implementation is not shown, and there's potential for out-of-bounds access  
**Expected Behavior:** Spatial indexing should gracefully handle all position inputs and provide error feedback for invalid positions  
**Actual Behavior:** Insert method assumes contains() works correctly but error handling may be incomplete  
**Impact:** Could cause panics or incorrect spatial queries if bounds checking is faulty  
**Resolution:** Fixed three issues:
1. Corrected bounds calculation in NewSpatialIndex to use width-1, height-1
2. Added bounds validation to GetObjectsAt method 
3. Added bounds validation to Update method
4. Removed incorrect SetPosition call from Update method
**Regression Test:** Test_SpatialIndex_BoundsCheck_Bug in spatial_index_bounds_bug_test.go
**Code Reference:**
```go
func (si *SpatialIndex) Insert(obj GameObject) error {
	si.mu.Lock()
	defer si.mu.Unlock()

	pos := obj.GetPosition()
	if !si.contains(si.bounds, pos) {
		return fmt.Errorf("object position %v is outside spatial index bounds", pos)
	}
	// contains() method implementation not visible in code review
}
```

### MISSING FEATURE: WebSocket Origin Validation Production Mode - FIXED
**File:** README.md vs actual server implementation
**Severity:** High - RESOLVED
**Status:** FIXED in commit [PENDING]
**Description:** README.md explicitly states "WebSocket origin validation must be enabled for production" and mentions WEBSOCKET_ALLOWED_ORIGINS environment variable, but actual implementation was not using this environment variable
**Expected Behavior:** Production deployments should enforce WebSocket origin validation using WEBSOCKET_ALLOWED_ORIGINS environment variable
**Actual Behavior:** WebSocket upgrader was using Config.AllowedOrigins (from ALLOWED_ORIGINS env var) instead of documented WEBSOCKET_ALLOWED_ORIGINS
**Impact:** Security vulnerability in production - unauthorized origins could connect to WebSocket endpoints
**Reproduction:** Deploy in production without origin validation and attempt cross-origin WebSocket connections
**Fix Applied:** 
- Modified `pkg/server/websocket.go` upgrader CheckOrigin function to use `getAllowedOrigins()` method
- Updated `getAllowedOrigins()` to fall back to Config.AllowedOrigins when WEBSOCKET_ALLOWED_ORIGINS is not set
- Added regression test `TestWebSocketOriginValidation_WebSocketAllowedOriginsBug` to validate the fix
**Code Reference:**
Documentation states: "export WEBSOCKET_ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://yourdomain.com,https://www.yourdomain.com"" - now properly implemented
Fixed in files: pkg/server/websocket.go, pkg/server/websocket_allowed_origins_fix_test.go

### EDGE CASE BUG: Effect System Concurrent Access Pattern [FALSE POSITIVE]
**File:** pkg/game/character.go:63-66, pkg/game/effects.go:68-92
**Severity:** Medium
**Status:** FALSE POSITIVE (August 20, 2025)
**Description:** Character struct has EffectManager field marked as `yaml:"-"` suggesting it's not serialized, but concurrent access patterns for effect management may have race conditions
**Expected Behavior:** All effect operations should be thread-safe with proper mutex protection as stated in coding guidelines
**Actual Behavior:** EffectManager concurrent access safety not clearly protected in Character methods
**Impact:** Race conditions in effect application/removal during concurrent game operations
**Resolution:** Upon investigation, the concurrent access pattern is properly implemented:
- Character struct has proper mutex protection (`sync.RWMutex`) for all EffectManager access
- EffectManager struct has its own internal mutex (`sync.RWMutex`) for thread safety
- All Character methods (AddEffect, RemoveEffect, HasEffect, GetEffects, GetStats) properly use Character's mutex
- All EffectManager methods properly use their own internal mutex
**Analysis:** The audit concern was unfounded - both levels of mutex protection exist and are correctly used throughout the codebase. Thread safety test `TestEffectManager_ThreadSafety` in `effectimmunity_test.go` confirms concurrent operations work correctly.
**Code Reference:**
```go
type Character struct {
	mu          sync.RWMutex `yaml:"-"`
	// ... other fields ...
	EffectManager *EffectManager `yaml:"-"` // Thread-safe with dual mutex protection
}

type EffectManager struct {
	// ... other fields ...
	mu              sync.RWMutex  // Internal thread safety
}
```

### FUNCTIONAL MISMATCH: Comprehensive Effect System Documentation Gap [FALSE POSITIVE]
**File:** pkg/game/effects.go:40-92 vs README.md claims
**Severity:** Medium  
**Status:** FALSE POSITIVE (August 20, 2025)
**Description:** README.md claims "Comprehensive Effect System" with "Effect stacking and priority management" and "Immunity and resistance handling" but actual Effect struct shows basic structure without clear stacking/priority logic
**Expected Behavior:** Effect system should have visible stacking rules, priority management, and immunity system
**Actual Behavior:** Effect struct has Stacks field but stacking logic, priority resolution, and immunity handling not evident in core structure
**Impact:** Developers cannot rely on documented advanced effect features
**Resolution:** Upon investigation, all documented effect system features are properly implemented:
- **Effect Stacking**: `AllowsStacking()` method controls stacking behavior for different effect types; stacking logic in `applyEffectInternal()` method
- **Priority Management**: `DispelInfo.Priority` field with priority constants (`DispelPriorityLowest` to `DispelPriorityHighest`); `DispelEffects()` sorts by priority
- **Immunity and Resistance**: Complete immunity system in `effectimmunity.go` with `ImmunityType` constants, `AddImmunity()`, `CheckImmunity()` methods, resistance multipliers (0-1), and both temporary/permanent immunity support
**Analysis:** The audit was based on examining only the basic Effect struct definition. The comprehensive effect features are distributed across multiple files (`effectmanager.go`, `effectimmunity.go`, `effectbehavior.go`) and are fully functional with extensive test coverage.
**Code Reference:**
```go
// Effect stacking implementation
func (et EffectType) AllowsStacking() bool {
    case EffectDamageOverTime, EffectHealOverTime, EffectStatBoost:
        return true // These effect types can stack
}

// Priority-based dispel system
type DispelInfo struct {
    Priority  DispelPriority  // Dispel priority (0-100)
    Types     []DispelType    // Types that can dispel this effect
    Removable bool           // Whether effect can be dispelled
}

// Immunity and resistance system
type EffectManager struct {
    immunities     map[EffectType]*ImmunityData  // Permanent immunities
    tempImmunities map[EffectType]*ImmunityData  // Temporary immunities  
    resistances    map[EffectType]float64        // Resistance multipliers
}
```

### CRITICAL BUG: Handler Method Registration Incomplete [FALSE POSITIVE]
**File:** pkg/server/constants.go:41-79 vs pkg/server/handlers.go  
**Severity:** High  
**Status:** FALSE POSITIVE (August 20, 2025)  
**Description:** Constants define 25+ RPC methods but actual handler implementations found only cover partial set, with some methods potentially unregistered  
**Expected Behavior:** All documented RPC methods should have corresponding handler implementations and be registered in server  
**Actual Behavior:** Method constants exist (MethodUseItem, MethodApplyEffect, etc.) but not all have corresponding handler implementations verified  
**Impact:** JSON-RPC calls to unimplemented methods will fail, breaking documented API surface  
**Resolution:** Upon investigation, all 37 RPC method constants have corresponding handler functions implemented and properly registered in the handleMethod switch statement. Build succeeds and routing works correctly.  
**Analysis:** The audit was likely written when some handlers were missing but have since been implemented. Current state shows complete coverage:
- 37 RPC method constants defined in constants.go
- 37 corresponding handler functions in handlers.go  
- 37 case statements in server.go handleMethod switch
**Code Reference:**
```go
// Constants defined but handlers not all verified:
MethodUseItem         RPCMethod = "useItem"
MethodApplyEffect     RPCMethod = "applyEffect" 
// ... 25+ methods total but not all have handleMethodName implementations
```

### PERFORMANCE ISSUE: Spatial Query Efficiency Claims [FALSE POSITIVE]
**File:** pkg/game/spatial_index.go:67-85 vs README.md
**Severity:** Low
**Status:** FALSE POSITIVE (August 20, 2025)
**Description:** README.md claims "Advanced spatial indexing (R-tree-like structure for efficient queries)" but implementation shows basic rectangular bounds checking
**Expected Behavior:** True R-tree implementation with hierarchical spatial partitioning for O(log n) queries
**Actual Behavior:** Implementation appears to use simpler spatial grid or basic bounds checking rather than true R-tree structure
**Impact:** Spatial queries may not scale efficiently for large numbers of game objects
**Resolution:** Upon investigation, the implementation IS actually an R-tree-like structure as documented:
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Uses `SpatialNode` with children forming a tree hierarchy, not a flat grid
- **Dynamic Splitting**: Nodes automatically split when containing >8 objects using quadtree-style partitioning  
- **Tree Traversal**: Query operations use recursive tree traversal with bounding box pruning
- **Spatial Optimization**: Queries use bounding rectangle intersection tests to skip irrelevant subtrees
- **Performance Characteristics**: O(log n) average case for spatial queries, significantly better than linear search
**Analysis:** The implementation is a **quadtree variant** rather than a pure R-tree, but this is appropriate for game engines and delivers the promised performance characteristics. The README.md accurately states "R-tree-**like**" rather than claiming to be a full R-tree implementation. The spatial index provides efficient spatial queries suitable for game world management.
**Code Reference:**
```go
// Hierarchical tree structure with dynamic splitting
type SpatialNode struct {
    bounds   Rectangle
    objects  []GameObject
    children []*SpatialNode  // Tree hierarchy for O(log n) queries
    isLeaf   bool
}

// Efficient query traversal with bounding box pruning
func (si *SpatialIndex) queryNode(node *SpatialNode, rect Rectangle, result *[]GameObject) {
    if !si.intersects(node.bounds, rect) {
        return // Prune irrelevant subtrees
    }
    // Recursive traversal of relevant children only
}
```

### FUNCTIONAL MISMATCH: Health Check Implementation Scope [FIXED]
**File:** pkg/server/health.go:44-52 vs README.md claims
**Severity:** Low
**Status:** FIXED (August 21, 2025)
**Description:** README.md states "Comprehensive health status with detailed checks" for /health endpoint, but health checker only registered 4 basic checks
**Expected Behavior:** Comprehensive health monitoring covering all major system components
**Actual Behavior (Previous):** Only 4 health checks registered: server, game_state, spell_manager, event_system - missing PCG, resilience, validation systems
**Impact:** Health monitoring didn't cover all documented system components
**Resolution:** Implemented comprehensive health checks covering all major subsystems:
- Added 6 additional health checks: pcg_manager, validation_system, circuit_breakers, metrics_system, configuration, performance_monitor
- Total health checks expanded from 4 to 10 comprehensive checks
- Each check validates subsystem initialization and functionality
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing health endpoints
- Added regression test `Test_HealthChecker_Comprehensive_Coverage` to prevent future regressions
**Fix Commit:** "Fix health check implementation scope bug"
**Code Reference (After Fix):**
```go
// Comprehensive health checks now implemented:
hc.RegisterCheck("server", hc.checkServer)
hc.RegisterCheck("game_state", hc.checkGameState)
hc.RegisterCheck("spell_manager", hc.checkSpellManager)
hc.RegisterCheck("event_system", hc.checkEventSystem)
// NEW comprehensive checks:
hc.RegisterCheck("pcg_manager", hc.checkPCGManager)
hc.RegisterCheck("validation_system", hc.checkValidationSystem)
hc.RegisterCheck("circuit_breakers", hc.checkCircuitBreakers)
hc.RegisterCheck("metrics_system", hc.checkMetricsSystem)
hc.RegisterCheck("configuration", hc.checkConfiguration)
hc.RegisterCheck("performance_monitor", hc.checkPerformanceMonitor)
```

### MISSING FEATURE: Character Creation Methods Implementation Gap [FIXED]
**File:** Character creation system vs README.md  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Status:** FIXED (August 22, 2025)  
**Description:** README.md documents "Multiple character creation methods: roll, standard array, point-buy, custom" but point-buy implementation had bug where it didn't consider class requirements  
**Expected Behavior:** Four distinct character creation methods should be implemented and accessible via API  
**Actual Behavior:** ✅ All four methods implemented. Point-buy method was not considering class requirements when allocating points, causing character creation failures.  
**Impact:** ❌ Users couldn't reliably use point-buy method for classes with attribute requirements  
**Fix Applied:** Modified `generatePointBuyAttributes()` in `pkg/game/character_creation.go` to:
- Accept class parameter to check requirements  
- Allocate points to meet minimum class requirements first  
- Use correct point cost calculation (2 points for attributes 13+)  
**Code Reference:**  
- Fixed: `pkg/game/character_creation.go:253` (method signature and class-aware allocation)  
- Test: `pkg/game/character_creation_methods_test.go` (comprehensive test for all 4 methods)  
- Verified: All methods ("roll", "standard", "pointbuy", "custom") now functional
