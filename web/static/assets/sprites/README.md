# Graphic Assets

This directory contains sprite assets for the GoldBox RPG Engine frontend.

## Structure

Currently, this directory is prepared for game sprites and graphical assets that will be used by the TypeScript frontend rendering system.

## Future Assets

The following asset categories are planned:
- Character sprites (player classes, NPCs)
- Item icons (weapons, armor, consumables)
- Terrain tiles (floor, walls, doors)
- Effect sprites (spells, combat effects)
- UI elements (buttons, panels, icons)

## Integration

Assets placed in this directory will be accessible to the frontend rendering system through the static file server at `/static/assets/sprites/`.

## Formats

Recommended formats:
- PNG for sprites with transparency
- SVG for scalable UI elements
- WebP for optimized loading (where supported)
