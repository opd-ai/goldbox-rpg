A modern, Go-based RPG engine inspired by the classic SSI Gold Box series of role-playing games. This engine provides a comprehensive framework for creating and managing turn-based RPG games with robust combat systems, character management, and world interactions through a JSON-RPC API with WebSocket support for real-time communication.

export GOLDBOX_PORT=8080
export GOLDBOX_LOG_LEVEL=warn
```

**Important:** The WebSocket origin validation is automatically enabled in production mode. Make sure to set `WEBSOCKET_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to include all legitimate client domains to prevent unauthorized cross-origin connections.3E%3D1.23.0-blue)

A modern, Go-based RPG engine inspired by the classic SSI Gold Box series of role-playing games. This engine provides a comprehensive framework for creating and managing turn-based RPG games with robust combat systems, character management, and world interactions through a JSON-RPC API with WebSocket support for real-time communication.

## 🎮 Features

### Core Game Systems
- **Character Management**
  - Six core attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma
  - Class-based system (Fighter, Mage, Cleric, Thief, Ranger, Paladin)
  - Multiple character creation methods: roll, standard array, point-buy, custom
  - Equipment and inventory management with class proficiency restrictions
  - Experience and level progression with automatic stat calculations

### Combat & Effects
- **Comprehensive Effect System**
  - Status effects (Damage over Time, Healing over Time)
  - Combat conditions (Stun, Root, Burning, Bleeding, Poison)
  - Stat modifications (Boosts and Penalties)
  - Effect stacking and priority management
  - Immunity and resistance handling

### World Management
- **Dynamic World System**
  - Tile-based environments with multiple terrain types
  - Multiple damage types (Physical, Fire, Poison, Frost, Lightning)
  - ✅ Advanced spatial indexing (R-tree-like structure for efficient queries)
  - Object and NPC management with procedural generation
  - Combat positioning and line-of-sight calculations

### Event System
- **Event-Driven Architecture**
  - Combat events
  - Quest updates
  - Item interactions
  - Spell casting
  - Level progression

### Real-time Communication
- **WebSocket Integration**
  - Live game state updates
  - Real-time event broadcasting
  - Session-based multiplayer support
  - Concurrent player management

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Health Check Endpoints**
  - `/health` - Comprehensive health status with detailed checks
  - `/ready` - Kubernetes-style readiness probe
  - `/live` - Basic liveness probe for load balancers
- **Metrics Integration**
  - Prometheus metrics endpoint at `/metrics`
  - Request/response monitoring
  - Session and performance tracking
  - Memory and goroutine monitoring

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.23.0 or higher
- Node.js 18+ and npm (for frontend development)
- Make (for build automation)
- **Docker** (recommended for easy setup)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/opd-ai/goldbox-rpg.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd goldbox-rpg

# Install dependencies
go mod download

# Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
make build
```

### Running with Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to run the GoldBox RPG Engine is using Docker:

```bash
# Build and run (that's it!)
docker build -t goldbox-rpg .
docker run -p 8080:8080 goldbox-rpg

# Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser and play!
```

The Docker container includes automatic health checks. You can verify the server status:

```bash
# Check health status
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# Check readiness (for load balancers)
curl http://localhost:8080/ready

# View metrics (Prometheus format)
curl http://localhost:8080/metrics
```

### Running Locally

For local development without Docker:

```bash
# Start the Go backend
make run

# In another terminal, start the frontend development server
npm run watch

# Access the application at http://localhost:8080
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run Go backend tests
make test

# Run Go tests with coverage
make test-coverage

# Run TypeScript type checking
npm run typecheck
```
### Production Deployment

For production deployments, configure the following environment variables for security:

```bash
# Required for production WebSocket origin validation
export WEBSOCKET_ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://yourdomain.com,https://www.yourdomain.com"
# Alternative: ALLOWED_ORIGINS for configuration-based origin validation

# Example production configuration
export GOLDBOX_PORT=8080
export GOLDBOX_LOG_LEVEL=warn
```

**Important:** The WebSocket origin validation is automatically enabled in production mode. Make sure to set `WEBSOCKET_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to include all legitimate client domains to prevent unauthorized cross-origin connections.
